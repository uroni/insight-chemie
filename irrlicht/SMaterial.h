	enum E_MATERIAL_TYPE
	{
		//! Standard solid material. Only first texture is used, which is
		//! supposed to be the diffuse material.
		EMT_SOLID = 0,			

		//! Solid material with 2 texture layers. The second is blended onto the
		//! first using the alpha value of the vertex colors.
		//! This material is currently not implemented in OpenGL, but it
		//! works with DirectX.
		EMT_SOLID_2_LAYER,

		//! Material type with standard lightmap technique: 
		//! There should be 2 textures: The first texture layer is a diffuse map,
		//! the second is a light map. Vertex light is ignored.
		EMT_LIGHTMAP,

		//! Material type with lightmap technique like EMT_LIGHTMAP, but
		//! lightmap and diffuse texture are not modulated, but added instead.
		EMT_LIGHTMAP_ADD,

		//! Material type with standard lightmap technique: 
		//! There should be 2 textures: The first texture layer is a diffuse map,
		//! the second is a light map. Vertex light is ignored.
		//! The texture colors are effectively multiplyied by 2 for brightening.
		//! like known in DirectX as D3DTOP_MODULATE2X.
		EMT_LIGHTMAP_M2,

		//! Material type with standard lightmap technique: 
		//! There should be 2 textures: The first texture layer is a diffuse map,
		//! the second is a light map. Vertex light is ignored.
		//! The texture colors are effectively multiplyied by 4 for brightening.
		//! like known in DirectX as D3DTOP_MODULATE4X.
		EMT_LIGHTMAP_M4,

		//! Like EMT_LIGHTMAP, but also supports dynamic lighting.
		EMT_LIGHTMAP_LIGHTING,

		//! Like EMT_LIGHTMAP_M2, but also supports dynamic lighting.
		EMT_LIGHTMAP_LIGHTING_M2,

		//! Like EMT_LIGHTMAP_4, but also supports dynamic lighting.
		EMT_LIGHTMAP_LIGHTING_M4,

		//! Makes the material look like it was reflection the environment
		//! around it. To make this possible, a texture called 'sphere map'
		//! is used, which must be set as Texture1.
		EMT_SPHERE_MAP,

		//! A reflecting material with an 
		//! optional additional non reflecting texture layer. The reflection
		//! map should be set as Texture 1.
		//! Please note that this material type is currently not 100% implemented
		//! in OpenGL. It works in DirectX8.
		EMT_REFLECTION_2_LAYER,

		//! A transparent material. Only the first texture is used.
		//! The new color is calculated by simply adding the source color and
		//! the dest color. This means if for example a billboard using a texture with 
		//! black background and a red circle on it is drawed with this material, the
		//! result is that only the red circle will be drawn a little bit transparent,
		//! and everything which was black is 100% transparent and not visible.
		//! This material type is useful for e.g. particle effects.
		EMT_TRANSPARENT_ADD_COLOR,

		//! Makes the material transparent based on the texture alpha channel.
		//! Only first texture is used. Please note that this material is currenly
		//! NOT IMPLEMENTED.
		EMT_TRANSPARENT_ALPHA_CHANNEL,	

		//! Makes the material transparent based on the vertex alpha value.
		EMT_TRANSPARENT_VERTEX_ALPHA,

		//! A transparent reflecting material with an 
		//! optional additional non reflecting texture layer. The reflection
		//! map should be set as Texture 1. The transparency depends on the
		//! alpha value in the vertex colors. A texture which will not reflect
		//! can be set als Texture 2.
		//! Please note that this material type is currently not 100% implemented
		//! in OpenGL. It works in DirectX8.
		EMT_TRANSPARENT_REFLECTION_2_LAYER,

		//! A solid normal map renderer. First texture is the color map, the 
		//! second should be the normal map. Note that you should use this material
		//! only when drawing geometry consisting of vertices of type S3DVertexTangents 
		//! (EVT_TANGENTS). You can convert any mesh into this format using
		//! IMeshManipulator::createMeshWithTangents() (See SpecialFX2 Tutorial).
		//! This shader runs on vertex shader 1.1 and pixel shader 1.1 capable hardware and 
		//! falls back on a fixed function lighted material if this hardware is not available.
		//! Only two lights are supported by this shader, if there are more, the nearest two
		//! are chosen. Currently, this shader is only implemented for the D3D8 and D3D9 renderers.
		EMT_NORMAL_MAP_SOLID,

		//! A transparent normal map renderer. First texture is the color map, the 
		//! second should be the normal map. Note that you should use this material
		//! only when drawing geometry consisting of vertices of type S3DVertexTangents 
		//! (EVT_TANGENTS). You can convert any mesh into this format using
		//! IMeshManipulator::createMeshWithTangents() (See SpecialFX2 Tutorial).
		//! This shader runs on vertex shader 1.1 and pixel shader 1.1 capable hardware and

		//! are chosen. Currently, this shader is only implemented for the D3D8 and D3D9 renderers.
		EMT_NORMAL_MAP_TRANSPARENT_ADD_COLOR,

		//! A transparent (based on the vertex alpha value) normal map renderer.
		//! First texture is the color map, the 
		//! second should be the normal map. Note that you should use this material
		//! only when drawing geometry consisting of vertices of type S3DVertexTangents 
		//! (EVT_TANGENTS). You can convert any mesh into this format using
